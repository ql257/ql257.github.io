![](about.jpg)
My name is Qiwen (Krystal) Li, I am currently an early master of engineering student majoring in operations research and information engineering at Cornell. I have spent a few summers working at startups as IT intern and I have also worked as data management intern at a non-profit organization. Currently, I am working with a business tech company called deluxe, which helps financial institutions with customer acquisition, retention, and cross-sell. I am working with the data science team on building models to better target people who are more likely to respond to an unsecured personal loan.  

On campus, I focus my study on the use of analytic techniques for optimization of system performances. Mainly, I use Python to develop data visualization and machine learning projects. 

Outside of school, I am very passionate about learning new things like learning a new tech (figma) or new dance. I am also love travelling.
